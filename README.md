## Description
Highlighter is a simple MERN-stack application that allows users to log events on a calendar to stay organized and up-to-date.
## Installation
We utilized GraphQL, Node.js, Express, React, MongoDB and Mongoose. 

## Usage
- User can use the app to create events on a calendar.
- User is first presented with a homepage with a login and signup form.

- User can signup for a new account or login to an existing account when they click on the login/signup button.
- Once logged in, the user is taken to a page where a blank calendar shows up and a sign out button. 
- The user can click on a specific day and add/modify/delete an event. 
- As a user scrolls through the months, they can view their events saved on the page.
